This is my fifth blog post! I'm getting more comfortable with Astro and enjoying the process of building my own blog site from scratch.

## What I've Learned

- How to create markdown blog posts
- How to use layouts for consistent styling
- How to organize content in an Astro project
- Using `Astro.glob()` to fetch and display multiple posts

Next, I plan to explore more advanced Astro features and add some interactive components to my site!
